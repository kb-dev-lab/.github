The KlaB is a non-profit organization managed by KBDev.

Our goal is to create great apps without any shape of ads, money or data usage.
We love what open-source bring to us since a long time, so we want to continue to deliver free softwares for everyone, even as a company.

Everyone can contribue to our projects.
